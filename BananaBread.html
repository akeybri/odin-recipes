    <ul> -1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</ul>
     <ul> -1/2 cup (110g) unsalted butter, melted</ul>
    <ul>-2 large eggs</ul>
    <ul> -1/2 cup (130g) 2% Greek yogurt (sour cream also works)</ul>

<ul>-Preheat your oven to 325F and grease and line a 9Ã—5 loaf pan with parchment paper.</ul>

<ul>-In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</ul>
<ul>-In a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter and sugars until you reach a paste-like consistency. This may take some vigorous whisking for a minute or two. You can either use a whisk or an electric mixer with the paddle attachment.</ul>
<ul>-Add in your mashed bananas followed by the eggs, yogurt, and vanilla.</ul>
<ul>-Once all of your wet ingredients are mixed together, fold in the dry ingredients. Then, fold in the chocolate chips.</ul>
<ul>-Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and spread it even. Sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top if you like.</ul>
<ul>-Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs. Let it cool completely before removing from the pan. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container</ul>
